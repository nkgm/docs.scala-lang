In the next few lessons you’ll see a couple of tools that are commonly used in Scala projects:

- The [sbt build tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org)
- [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org), a code testing framework

We’ll start by showing how to use sbt, and then you’ll see how to use ScalaTest and sbt together to build and test your Scala projects.
