## Using Scala Traits as Interfaces

One way to use a Scala `trait` is like the original Java `interface`, where you define the desired interface for some piece of functionality, but you don’t implement any behavior.



## A simple example

As an example to get us started, imagine that you want to write some code to model animals like dogs and cats, any animal that has a tail. In Scala you write a trait to start that modeling process like this:

```scala
trait TailWagger {
    def startTail(): Unit
    def stopTail(): Unit
}
```

That code declares a trait named `TailWagger` that states that any class that extends `TailWagger` should implement `startTail` and `stopTail` methods. Both of those methods take no input parameters and have no return value. This code is equivalent to this Java interface:

```java
public interface TailWagger {
    public void startTail();
    public void stopTail();
}
```



## Extending a trait

Given this trait:

```scala
trait TailWagger {
    def startTail(): Unit
    def stopTail(): Unit
}
```

you can write a class that extends the trait and implements those methods like this:

```scala
class Dog extends TailWagger {
    // the implemented methods
    def startTail(): Unit = println("tail is wagging")
    def stopTail(): Unit = println("tail is stopped")
}
```

You can also write those methods like this, if you prefer:

```scala
class Dog extends TailWagger {
    def startTail() = println("tail is wagging")
    def stopTail() = println("tail is stopped")
}
```

Notice that in either case, you use the `extends` keyword to create a class that extends a single trait:

```scala
class Dog extends TailWagger { ...
          -------
```

If you paste the `TailWagger` trait and `Dog` class into the Scala REPL, you can test the code like this:

```scala
scala> val d = new Dog
d: Dog = Dog@234e9716

scala> d.startTail
tail is wagging

scala> d.stopTail
tail is stopped
```

This demonstrates how you implement a single Scala trait with a class that extends the trait.



## Extending multiple traits

Scala lets you create very modular code with traits. For example, you can break down the attributes of animals into small, logical, modular units:

```scala
trait Speaker {
    def speak(): String
}

trait TailWagger {
    def startTail(): Unit
    def stopTail(): Unit
}

trait Runner {
    def startRunning(): Unit
    def stopRunning(): Unit
}
```

Once you have those small pieces, you can create a `Dog` class by extending all of them, and implementing the necessary methods:

```scala
class Dog extends Speaker with TailWagger with Runner {

    // Speaker
    def speak(): String = "Woof!"

    // TailWagger
    def startTail(): Unit = println("tail is wagging")
    def stopTail(): Unit = println("tail is stopped")

    // Runner
    def startRunning(): Unit = println("I'm running")
    def stopRunning(): Unit = println("Stopped running")

}
```

Notice how `extends` and `with` are used to create a class from multiple traits:

```scala
class Dog extends Speaker with TailWagger with Runner {
          -------         ----            ----
```

Key points of this code:

- Use `extends` to extend the first trait
- Use `with` to extend subsequent traits

From what you’ve seen so far, Scala traits work just like Java interfaces. But there’s more ...
