Scala lets you write code in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style, a functional programming (FP) style, and even in a hybrid style, using both approaches in combination. This book assumes that you’re coming to Scala from an OOP language like Java, C++, or C#, so outside of covering Scala classes, there aren’t any special sections about OOP in this book. But because the FP style is still relatively new to many developers, we’ll provide a brief introduction to Scala’s support for FP in the next several lessons.

*Functional programming* is a style of programming that emphasizes writing applications using only pure functions and immutable values. As Alvin Alexander wrote in [Functional Programming, Simplified](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/functional-programming-simplified-book), rather than using that description, it can be helpful to say that functional programmers have an extremely strong desire to see their code as math — to see the combination of their functions as a series of algebraic equations. In that regard, you could say that functional programmers like to think of themselves as mathematicians. That’s the driving desire that leads them to use *only* pure functions and immutable values, because that’s what you use in algebra and other forms of math.

Functional programming is a large topic, and there’s no simple way to condense the entire topic into this little book, but in the following lessons we’ll give you a taste of FP, and show some of the tools Scala provides for developers to write functional code.
