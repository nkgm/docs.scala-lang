The **Scala Improvement Process** covers changes to the Scala
language, the Scala compiler, and the core of the Scala standard
library.

## Scala Improvement Process

The _Scala Improvement Process_ is a process for submitting
changes to the Scala language. This process aims to evolve Scala
openly and collaboratively.

The process covers the Scala language and compiler and the core of
the Scala standard library.  (The core is anything that is unlikely to
be spun off into a separate module.)

A proposed change requires a design document, called a Scala
Improvement Proposal (SIP).  The SIP committee meets monthly to
discuss, and eventually vote upon, proposals.

A SIP is subject to a [review process]({% link _sips/process-specification.md %}).
Proposals normally include proposed changes to the
[Scala language specification](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/).
Before reaching the committee, a proposal normally receives community
discussion and review on the
[Scala Contributors](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/) forum.
Please read the [SIP tutorial]({% link _sips/sip-tutorial.md %}) or
[the process specification]({% link _sips/process-specification.md %}) for more
information.

The aim of the Scala Improvement Process is to apply the openness and
collaboration that have shaped Scala's documentation and implementation to the
process of evolving the language. The linked documents capture our guidelines,
commitments and expectations regarding this process.

> Historical note: The SIP replaces the older SID (Scala Improvement Document) process.
> Completed SID documents remain available in the
> [completed section of the SIP list](all.html).
